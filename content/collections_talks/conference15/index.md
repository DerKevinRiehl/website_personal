Should Switzerland expand its highway infrastructure?
In a panel discussion at ETH, together with Lukas Ballo and Marco Miotti, I had the pleasure to discuss this important Swiss referendum question on November 13th. As it is often the case in political discussions, not the most suitable, or most scientific arguments are used from both sides for discussion. During the discussion we had the chance to provide some scientific input to the discussion, and validate arguments from both sides.
Thanks Alicia Canomeras, Samuel Joray, Michaël B. and Michał Oskędra for the organization! 

Engaging in such discussions is crucial as we navigate the future of transportation in Switzerland. Let's continue to advocate for informed dialogue on infrastructure development!
