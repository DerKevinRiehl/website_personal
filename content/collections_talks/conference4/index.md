We connect university students with disadvantaged children from surrounding schools using sport to promote higher education in STEM.

This project was initiated at the SDG summer school of the IDEA League at Politecnico di Milano in July 2024. The task was to develop an idea that combines sports and the IDEA League universities to address the SDGs.
On our life paths, we observed severe inequalities to pursue higher education and deeply care about enabling everyone to have the same opportunities that we enjoyed. Inspired by our engagements in engineers without border in Tansania, and tutoring at orphanages, we dedicated our submission to Sport4STEM.
We are convinced, that higher education of the next generations, especially in STEM fields, is the key for sustainable development. Especially targeting vulnerable communities is helpful to reduce inequalities, improve quality of education, and fight poverty.
