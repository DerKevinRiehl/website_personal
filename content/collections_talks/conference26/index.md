#abstract: Vehicle trajectories offer valuable insights for various road transportation applications. Trajectories allow to model realistic driving behaviors (car-following, lane-changing), and real-world traffic patterns (oscillation propagation, capacity drops). Besides, trajectories are helpful when developing driving safety systems and support road infrastructure planning, design and control. Optical vehicle extraction with cameras is more precise than using GPS sensors, due to higher resolution of video streams in time and space, less prone to sensor synchronization issues and allow to cover all vehicles on a road in the field of view of a camera. Increasingly, perspectives from above using a drone (aerial view) are used. Existing algorithms employ Horizontal Bounding Box Object Detection (HBB), which is problematic due to issues such as occlusion, dynamic backgrounds, and changing vehicle appearance under different light and weather conditions. Oriented Bounding Box Detection (OBB) more precisely encloses objects of interest, thus decreases noise of backgrounds and occlusion.

*105th Annual Meeting of the Transportation Research Board (TRB 2026), Washington, DC, USA, January 11-15, 2026*

Most transportation publications to date lack sufficient transparency in terms of open source and data, in order to enable reproducibility. This work sets out to highlight the need for reproducibility of computational simulation studies, and to develop the level of professionality in the transportation domain when it comes to open source. Moreover, this work aims to equip the readers with a guide on best practices inspired by the computer science domain, templates for documentation of software and data, and guidelines on repository management and open source. The empirical analysis of more than 11,879 simulation studies and 672 repositories in the field reveals that only few works (less than 2%) share supplementary material alongside the scientific publication, on a mostly mediocre repository quality, but with a strong trend towards more transparency in the last years. Besides, simulation studies with enhanced transparency are found to not receive significantly more citations when compared with studies that do not provide additional repositories. What’s more, a survey of more than 87 transportation researchers conveys that reproducibility is perceived as a significant issue by the community, and that time and legal constraints are the largest impediments to more reproducible research.
