It was a great pleasure to present at the ETH AI+X Summit 2024 from October 3rd to 4th, alongside my colleague Shaimaa El Baklish. We had the opportunity to showcase our work, "Vehicle Trajectory From Aerial Video Using Oriented Object Detection."

The event was a fantastic platform for making valuable connections, receiving insightful feedback, and exchanging ideas with some of the brightest minds in AI. Looking forward to building on these conversations and future collaborations! Many thanks to ETH AI Center for the invitation!
