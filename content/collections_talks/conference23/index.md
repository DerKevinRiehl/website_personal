*D-BAUG Research Day 2025: From Micro to Macro*

On 7 October 2025, the Association of Scientific Staff at D-BAUG invites all students, researchers and professors to the department’s annual “Meet & Share” event. This year’s theme will be “From Micro to Macro”, highlighting the variety of scales that researchers at our department work on – from the smallest processes to large-scale systems. Doctoral candidates and researchers from all institutes will present selected case studies. Join us for an afternoon of exchange, insight and inspiration!
