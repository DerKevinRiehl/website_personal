abstract: Most cities do not charge for driving. Do you think that is fair? It causes externalities such as noise and pollution to residents and shops. In peak-hours of congestion, valuable life time, money, and fuel are wasted. Do you think driving in the city should be priced? Do you that is fair? This might systematically exclude the poor from the streets. How can we balance these distributional conflicts? [...] "Karma is independent of the economic situation of individuals, as it cannot be circumvented with money"
