Financial markets present a vast array of non-physical products, each with a price that is not simply dictated by tangible factors but is instead the result of complex interpretations made by market participants. These prices are shaped by the continuous flow of information, ranging from economic data and company earnings reports to geopolitical events and market sentiment. The challenge lies in understanding the myriad sources of this information, how it is processed by various market players, and the mechanisms through which it ultimately influences the valuation of financial products. This intricate relationship between information flow, interpretation, and price formation is the central research question that seeks to unravel the dynamics of financial markets, offering insights into the behavioral and informational forces that drive market movements.

In my research, I focus in particular on the role of credit rating agencies as key providers of credibility information, examining how these rankings affect capital costs, merger & acquisitions, stock and bond prices. 
Beyond the numerical ratings, I place a strong emphasis on textual information, delving into how language and narrative within financial reports, news articles, and other textual sources can be harnessed to extract reliable indicators. By analyzing these textual elements, I aim to uncover deeper insights into the broader contexts that shape financial markets, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the factors that drive investment decisions and market behaviors.
