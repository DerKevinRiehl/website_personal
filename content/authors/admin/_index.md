&emsp; &emsp; <ins>My Mission:</ins> My name is Kevin Riehl, and I am a cosmopolitan, technology enthusiast and philantrop.
I believe, that technology is the key to make the world a better place, and that learning, self-improvement, collaboration and critical thinking are our duty as gifted minds. 

&emsp; &emsp; <ins>Current Position:</ins> Currently, I work as a Doctoral Researcher at the [Institute for Transport Planning Systems (IVT)](https://www.ivt.ethz.ch/) and [AI Center](https://ai.ethz.ch/) of ETH Zurich, focusing on how we can leverage technology and control systems to advance road transportation and to promote fairness. 
My research focuses on **resource allocation mechanisms, artificial currencies, control, game theory, reinforcement learning, and fairness**.

&emsp; &emsp; <ins>My Journey:</ins> At the age of 12 I discovered my passion for computer science & technology. By training I am an industrial engineer, with two hearts beating in my breast: **engineering & business**. 
I studied electrical engineering, computer science, and finance at TU Darmstadt, wrote my master in bioinformatics at University of Cambridge. 
Besides, I gained **3 years+ work experience** in strategy consulting (AT Kearney, McKinsey), automotive industry (Opel, Continental, Volkswagen), and the finance industry (UBS, Credit Suisse, Swiss IT Security Group). 
During my journey, I had the chance to work with great, and inspiring people from **all over the world**, including Germany, China, United Kingdom, and Switzerland.
